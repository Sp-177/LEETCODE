## About

LeetCode is a popular platform for honing coding skills and preparing for technical interviews. This repository serves as a curated collection of my solutions to LeetCode problems, implemented in multiple programming languages including Python, Java, and C++.

## Structure

```
.
├── Problem-Name-1/
│   ├── solution1.py
│   ├── solution2.java
│   └── README.md
├── Problem-Name-2/
│   ├── solution1.cpp
│   └── README.md
└── ...
```

Each problem is meticulously organized into its own directory named after the problem. Within each directory, you'll find:

- `solution1.ext`: Comprehensive solutions implemented in various programming languages.
- `README.md`: Detailed explanations of the problem and my approach to solving it.
